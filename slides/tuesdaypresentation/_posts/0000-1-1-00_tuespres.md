# What are the features of a good program?

A good program:
- runs correctly
- is easy to understand
- is easy to design 
- is easy to modify 
- give correct results
- runs efficiently

---

# Define the terms: data, file, record, and primary key

Data: a value or set of values<br />
File: a collection of data related records<br />
Record: a collection of related records<br />
Primary key: A data item that uniquely identifies the record in the file<br />

---

# define data structures. give some examples 

A group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently<br />
Common Examples:<br />
- arrays 
- linked lists
- queues
- stacks
- binary trees 
- hash tables

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Primative
  - The fundamental data types supported by a programming language
  - Some basic data types:
    - Integer
    - Real
    - Character
    - Boolean

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Non-Primitive
  - Data structures that are created using primitive data structures
    - Linear
      - If the elements are stored in a linear or sequential order
      - Examples:
        - Arrays
        - Linked lists
        - Stacks
        - Queues
      - Can be represented two ways in memory
        - To have a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations
        - Have a linear relationship between elements by means of links
    - Non-Linear
      - Elements of data structure not stored in sequential order
      - The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between the elements
      - Examples
        - Trees
        - Graphs

# Discuss the applications of data structures

# Arrays

- A collection of similar data elements
- The elements have the same data type
- The elements of arrays are stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an index
- Used when we want to store large amounts of similar data types
- Have limitations
  - Arrays are of fixed size
  - Data elements are stored in contiguous memory locations which may not be always available
  - Insertion and deletion of elements can be problematic because of shifting elements from their positions

---

# Linked lists

- A very flexible, dynamic data structure where elements form a sequential list
- The programmer does not need to worry about how many elements are stored in the list
- Enables programmers to write robust programs with less maintenance
- In the list each node is allocated space as it is added to the list 
- Every node in the list points to the next node in the list
- Every node contains two types of data
  - The value of the node or any other data that corresponds to that node
  - A pointer or link to the next node in the list
- The last node in the list contains a null pointer to indicate that it is the end or tail of the list
- Since the memory for a node is allocated dynamically the total number of nodes that my be added to a list is limited only by the amount of memory available

---

# Stacks

- A linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements are done at only one end, known as the top of the stack
- Has a last in first out structure because the last element added to the stack is the first element deleted from the stack
- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists 
- Every stack has a variable top associated with it
- Top is used to store the address of the topmost element of the stack
- It is this position from where the element will be added or deleted
- Max is the other variable which is used to store the maximum number if elements that a stack can store
- If top = null then the stack is empty if top = max - 1 the stack is full
- A stack supports three basic operations
  - Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
  - Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack
  - Peep: Returns the value of the topmost element of the stack
- Before inserting an element into the stack you have to check overflow conditions
- Before deleting an element from the stack you have to check for underflow conditions 
  - An underflow is when you try to delete from a stack that is already empty

---

# Queues

- First in first out data structure where the element that is inserted first is the first one to be taken out
- The elements in a queue are added at one end called the rear and removed from the other end called the front
- Like stacks queues can be implemented by arrays or linked lists
- Deletions are only done from the end of the queue
- You have to check for overflow and underflow conditions in a queue
- When the queue is full rear = max - 1
- When queue is empty front = NULL and rear = NULL

---

# Trees

- A non-linear data structure consisting of collection nodes arranged in a hierarchical order
- One node is the root node and the remaining nodes can be partitioned into disjoint sets so each set is a sub-tree node
- The simplest tree is a binary tree
  - Consists of a root node and left and right sub-trees, where both sub-trees is also a binary tree
  - Each node contains a data element, a left pointer which points to the left sub-tree and a right pointer which points to the right sub-tree
- The root element is the topmost node which is pointed by a ‘root’ pointer
- If root = NULL the tree is empty

---

# Graphs

- A non-linear data structure which is a collection of vertices and edges that connect the vertices 
- Often viewed as a generalization of the tree structure where instead of a purely parent to child relationship between tree nodes any kind of complex relationship between the nodes can exist
- In trees nodes can only have one parent but in graphs it does not matter
- A node in the graph can represent a city and the edges connecting the nodes can be roads 
- A graph can represent a computer network where the nodes are workstations and the edges are network connections
- Graphs do not have a root node 
- Every node in the graph can be connected with every other node in the graph
- When two nodes are connected via an edge the two nodes are known as neighbours
