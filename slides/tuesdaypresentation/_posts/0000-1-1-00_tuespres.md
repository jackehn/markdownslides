# What are the features of a good program?

A good program:
- runs correctly
- is easy to understand
- is easy to design 
- is easy to modify 
- give correct results
- runs efficiently

---

# Define the terms: data, file, record, and primary key

Data: a value or set of values<br />
File: a collection of data related records<br />
Record: a collection of related records<br />
Primary key: A data item that uniquely identifies the record in the file<br />

---

# define data structures. give some examples 

A group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently<br />
Common Examples:<br />
- arrays 
- linked lists
- queues
- stacks
- binary trees 
- hash tables

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Primative
  - The fundamental data types supported by a programming language
  - Some basic data types:
    - Integer
    - Real
    - Character
    - Boolean

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Non-Primitive
  - Data structures that are created using primitive data structures
    - Linear
      - If the elements are stored in a linear or sequential order
      - Examples:
        - Arrays
        - Linked lists
        - Stacks
        - Queues
      - Can be represented two ways in memory
        - To have a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations
        - Have a linear relationship between elements by means of links
    - Non-Linear
      - Elements of data structure not stored in sequential order
      - The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between the elements
      - Examples
        - Trees
        - Graphs

# Discuss the applications of data structures

---

# Arrays

- A collection of similar data elements
- The elements have the same data type
- The elements of arrays are stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an index
- Used when we want to store large amounts of similar data types
- Have limitations
  - Arrays are of fixed size
  - Data elements are stored in contiguous memory locations which may not be always available
  - Insertion and deletion of elements can be problematic because of shifting elements from their positions

---

# Linked lists

- A very flexible, dynamic data structure where elements form a sequential list
- The programmer does not need to worry about how many elements are stored in the list
- Enables programmers to write robust programs with less maintenance
- In the list each node is allocated space as it is added to the list 
- Every node in the list points to the next node in the list
- Every node contains two types of data
  - The value of the node or any other data that corresponds to that node
  - A pointer or link to the next node in the list
- The last node in the list contains a null pointer to indicate that it is the end or tail of the list
- Since the memory for a node is allocated dynamically the total number of nodes that my be added to a list is limited only by the amount of memory available

---

# Stacks

- A linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements are done at only one end, known as the top of the stack
- Has a last in first out structure because the last element added to the stack is the first element deleted from the stack
- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists 
- Every stack has a variable top associated with it
- Top is used to store the address of the topmost element of the stack
- It is this position from where the element will be added or deleted
- Max is the other variable which is used to store the maximum number if elements that a stack can store
- If top = null then the stack is empty if top = max - 1 the stack is full
- A stack supports three basic operations
  - Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
  - Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack
  - Peep: Returns the value of the topmost element of the stack
- Before inserting an element into the stack you have to check overflow conditions
- Before deleting an element from the stack you have to check for underflow conditions 
  - An underflow is when you try to delete from a stack that is already empty

---

# Queues

- First in first out data structure where the element that is inserted first is the first one to be taken out
- The elements in a queue are added at one end called the rear and removed from the other end called the front
- Like stacks queues can be implemented by arrays or linked lists
- Deletions are only done from the end of the queue
- You have to check for overflow and underflow conditions in a queue
- When the queue is full rear = max - 1
- When queue is empty front = NULL and rear = NULL

---

# Trees

- A non-linear data structure consisting of collection nodes arranged in a hierarchical order
- One node is the root node and the remaining nodes can be partitioned into disjoint sets so each set is a sub-tree node
- The simplest tree is a binary tree
  - Consists of a root node and left and right sub-trees, where both sub-trees is also a binary tree
  - Each node contains a data element, a left pointer which points to the left sub-tree and a right pointer which points to the right sub-tree
- The root element is the topmost node which is pointed by a ‘root’ pointer
- If root = NULL the tree is empty

---

# Graphs

- A non-linear data structure which is a collection of vertices and edges that connect the vertices 
- Often viewed as a generalization of the tree structure where instead of a purely parent to child relationship between tree nodes any kind of complex relationship between the nodes can exist
- In trees nodes can only have one parent but in graphs it does not matter
- A node in the graph can represent a city and the edges connecting the nodes can be roads 
- A graph can represent a computer network where the nodes are workstations and the edges are network connections
- Graphs do not have a root node 
- Every node in the graph can be connected with every other node in the graph
- When two nodes are connected via an edge the two nodes are known as neighbours

# Write a short note on different operations that can be performed on data structures

- Traversing
  - Accessing the data items one at the time to process that data item. The example given in the book is to access the names of the students in a database to print them out
- Searching
  - Finding the location of one or more data items given a constraint. The data items that are being searched may not exist. The example given in the book is searching all the students that got 100 in Math
- Inserting
  - Adding a new data item to the list of data items. The example given in the book is adding a new students that joined a course
- Deleting
  - Opposite of Inserting. Deleting a data item from the list of data items. The example given in the book is removing a student that left a course
- Sorting
  - Arranging the data items in some order such as ascending or descending. Sorting of data items can change dispensing on what the type of application is. The example in the book is sorting student names in alphabetical order
- Merging
  - Merging two lists of data items in a single list. An example would be merging the list of graduates with the list of students that studied here but not anymore

# Compare a linked list with an array

---

# Arrays

- Arrays are a collection of similar data items. These data items will contain the same type of data such as int or char. Arrays are declared in the following form - type name[size].
- Arrays have a few disadvantages such as:
  - Arrays have a fixed size
  - Data elements are stored in contiguous memory locations which are not always available
  - Inserting or deleting data elements can be problematic because the data elements shift from their original position

---

# Linked Lists

- A linked list is a very flexible data structure. In linked lists elements are called nodes that form a sequential list. This means that they can be used to write low maintenance, robust programs.
- In the linked list, each node is allocated a space as it is added to the list. Each of the nodes are pointing to the node next to them, this means that every node in the list has two types of data:
  - The data that they contain (int, char, etc.)
  - The pointer to the next node on the list
- The last node on the linked list points to NULL indicating that we are the end of the list or the tail of the list

# Write a short note on abstract data type.

Abstract data is what operation can be performed on the data rather than what the data is. This way an end user can use the data without having to care about what the data is.

---

# Explain the different types of data structures. Also discuss their merits and demerits.

There are only four types of data structures:<br />
- Primitive data structures
  - Primitive data structures are those data structures that are supported by the programming language
- Non-primitive data structures
  - Non-primitive data structures are those data structures that are created using primitive data structures. It can be divided into two sub categories
    - Linear data structures: If the elements are stored in a linear or sequential order, then its a linear data structure
    - Non-linear data structures: If the elements are not stored in a linear or sequential order, then its a non-linear data structure
