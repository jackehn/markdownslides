# What are the features of a good program?

A good program:
- runs correctly
- is easy to understand
- is easy to design 
- is easy to modify 
- give correct results
- runs efficiently

# Define the terms: data, file, record, and primary key

Data: a value or set of values<br />
File: a collection of data related records<br />
Record: a collection of related records<br />
Primary key: A data item that uniquely identifies the record in the file<br />

# define data structures. give some examples 

A group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently<br />
Common Examples:<br />
- arrays 
- linked lists
- queues
- stacks
- binary trees 
- hash tables

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Primative
  - The fundamental data types supported by a programming language
  - Some basic data types:
    - Integer
    - Real
    - Character
    - Boolean

# In how many ways can you categorize data structures? explain each term

Two ways to categorize data structures:<br />
- Non-Primitive
  - Data structures that are created using primitive data structures
    - Linear
      - If the elements are stored in a linear or sequential order
      - Examples:
        - Arrays
        - Linked lists
        - Stacks
        - Queues
      - Can be represented two ways in memory
        - To have a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations
        - Have a linear relationship between elements by means of links
    - Non-Linear
      - Elements of data structure not stored in sequential order
      - The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between the elements
      - Examples
        - Trees
        - Graphs
